# Bio-Prosthetic-Hand-Leg
Objective
To design and develop a low-cost, functional prosthetic limb that responds to user intent and restores basic movement, offering a lifelike alternative to expensive commercial prosthetics.

ðŸ”§ Features:
Electromyography (EMG) or sensor-based control.
Motorized joints for natural hand or leg movement.
Lightweight and ergonomic prosthetic design.
Rechargeable power supply for daily use.
Customizable fit for different users.

ðŸ§  Components Used:
Microcontroller (Arduino Nano / ESP32).
Servo or DC motors for joint actuation.
EMG sensors or flex sensors for input.
3D-printed or CNC-machined limb structure.
Battery pack with charging module.

ðŸ“Œ Applications:
Assistive wearable for upper and lower limb amputees.
Rehabilitation and mobility enhancement.
Biomedical and biomechatronics research.
Educational projects in prosthetics and robotics.
